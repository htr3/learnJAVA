    * Iterators in Java are used in the Collection framework to retrieve elements one by one.
    * It is a universal iterator as we can apply it to any Collection object. By using Iterator,
    *  we can perform both read and remove operations. It is an improved version of Enumeration
    * with the additional functionality of removing an element.
